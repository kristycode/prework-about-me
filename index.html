      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello!<br>
        I'm a artist in an auto claims adjuster's body. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm born, raised, and pretty currently situated in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I've always been passionate about creative outlets-- I started with digital illustration as a preteen, and it's expanded to thrifted fashion and collecting retro Japanese toys in my adulthood.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job, I think, would be something UI/UX related; I don't have enough coding or tech-specific experience to have much more of a specific direction right now, but hopefully that will change in the coming months! </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the same zip code I was born in.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've felt for a while now that my greatest assets lie in my creativity and penchant for design, but are severely underutilized in my career as a claims adjuster, and web development may be my best opportunity to marry my passions into a relevant career.</p>
